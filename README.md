For this self-project, I have analysed the data from [Goodreads Best Books Ever](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1.Best_Books_Ever?page=1) list which is made up of around 50K books to see the trends and patterns in the community and used the export from my goodreads account to assess how the reading habits align with those present in the readers' coterie.
